/*
 * SmartMatrix Library 4.x Unique Header File
 *
 * This file is here to give a unique header name so SmartMatrix 3.x and SmartMatrix 4.x can coexist in an Arduino Libraries folder
 *   
 * You can include "SmartMatrix.h", or "SmartMatrix4.h" in your sketch to compile with SmartMatrix 4.x
 * 
 * Include "SmartMatrix3.h if you have sketches that still use SmartMatrix 3.x 
 */

#include "SmartMatrix.h"
